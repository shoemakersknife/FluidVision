# Interactive Fluid Simulation

[Live Demo](https://shoemakersknife.github.io/FluidVision/)

As someone pursuing mechanical engineering, I was told that fluids are very important. They're everywhere.

Turbulence in engines

Airfoil design

Cooling systems

And so on...

I wanted to make a sleek physics simulation with a twist. We can't really grab rendered particles through the screen, but with some computer vision it's way more fun than using a mouse.

- Interactive WebGL rendered fluid simulation with real-time ML hand tracking.
- Utilized MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
- Containerized setup using Docker for easy deployment.  
- Configured for Nginx to access simulation through a browser.  
- Portable and scalable for cloud deployment using Kubernetes.
